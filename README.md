# Agriculture Supply Chain with Blockchain

This project uses blockchain to create a transparent, traceable supply chain for agro products, involving Farmers, Agro Traders, and Consumers. The frontend interacts directly with the blockchain, while the backend helps generate QR codes and manage metadata.

## Folder Structure:
- **`frontend/`**: React.js app for the user interface.
- **`backend/`**: Node.js and Express server for fetching blockchain data and QR code generation.
- **`blockchain/`**: Solidity smart contracts for data management and transaction handling.
