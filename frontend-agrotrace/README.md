# Frontend

This folder contains the React.js application responsible for the user interface. The frontend communicates directly with the Ethereum blockchain to interact with farmer and agro trader data. Users will be able to:
- Register as a farmer or agro trader
- View and register agro product data
- Generate and scan QR codes
- View product details from the blockchain

## Dependencies
- React.js
- Web3.js (for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain)
- Axios (for making API calls)
